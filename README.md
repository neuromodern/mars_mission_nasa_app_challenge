# Team

We are a team of enthusiastic dreamers into space and science! Grown up on movies, books and TV series about space and space travel!

Some of us are scientists, some of us are cool programmers, we are all different, but we are united by a common dream and vision, it is to make science and space part of our lives, to make science available to all people around.

We want people to share our joy and join our adventure to conquer space!

# Challenge

Imagine an Earth-orbiting satellite, or an Earth-to-Moon mission that requires an orbital transfer maneuver, or a spacecraft in a cyclical orbit around Earth and Mars, or a deep space probe that traverses the asteroid belt. Understanding and visualizing sophisticated space missions isnâ€™t easy! Your challenge is to create an interactive, virtual reality application that enables users to visualize a space mission including the mission concept, orbital trajectories, and mission timeline.
